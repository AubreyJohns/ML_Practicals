**Regularization** is done on the loss functions to avoid overfitting by the Model.

**L1 Regularization (Lasso)** is done on L1 lossfunction which is the Mean Absolute Error.

**L2 Regularization (Ridge)** is done on L2 lossfunction which is the Mean Squared Error.

# Linear_Regression_Regularization
Regularization of a Linear Regression Model. Both L1 and L2 regularization will be applied to the regressors.
