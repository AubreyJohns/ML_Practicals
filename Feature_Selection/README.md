**Feature Selection** involves reducing the number of existing independent features in order to get the most relevant features for prediction.

**Advantages:**

1. Improve the model's accuracy.

2. Deal with Overfitting.

3. Reduce time it takes to fit the model.

**Methods of Feature Selection:**

1. Embedders: Regularization Methods e.g.L1 

2. Filters: Select Features based on some indicator Matrix e.g.Information Gain

3. Wrappers e.g. Forward Selection, Backward Generator, Recurrent Feature Elimination
